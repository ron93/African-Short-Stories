    <h1>THE HARE,LION AND THE HYENA</h1>
    <article>
        <p>One day Lion killed a wildebeest, but it gored him before it died. Lion was left with an ugly gash in his belly. He was badly wounded and could hardly move. Many visitors came to pay him their respects, including the ant, the termite, the vulture, the crow, and the jackal. Many others came, including Sungura the hare. Pushing to the foreground, he addressed Lion: “I will keep house for you while you are ill. I will cook for you and clean the place!”</p>

        <p>Lion accepted this offer gratefully. Hare became his housekeeper and ate well every day. Soon Hyena became jealous and plotted to steal Hare’s good fortune. Hyena devised a plan. While Sungura the hare was running an errand, Hyena Hyena’s punishment.</p>

        <p>Hyena whispered in Lion’s ear: “Do you know that Hare is a well-known medicine man? Yet he does not give you any medicine. Why not? Because that is not in his interest. He wants you to be sick, so he can stay here and eat your meat.”</p>

        <p>Lion believed Hyena. When Hare came back, Lion said to him: “I am told that you have a medicine for my wound.” The alert Hare, perceiving who might be trying to play a trick on him, replied quickly: “Yes, I do, Sire. But, you see, the problem is that the medicine cannot be prepared without the hair that grows on a hyena’s neck.”</p>

        <p>Soon Hyena came back for another visit. The lovely smell of all that meat attracted him. Of course, he also hoped to create more mischief. Lion beckoned and whispered to him: “Come close, I want to tell you something.”</p>

        <p>When Hyena was close enough, Lion bit his neck to get some of the hairs that grew on it. Alas, poor Hyena! When Lion bites a neck, it breaks. His teeth go right through it. That is his job, you see. Of course, Hare knew such details, since his father had told him. There are many hares with a detailed knowledge of Lion’s teeth. Hyena, however, should have been more careful in trying to deceive Lion, and he should have thought twice before trying to trick Hare. If you want to outwit a hare, do not leave your brain at home.</p>
